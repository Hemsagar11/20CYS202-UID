## PROJECT-01: Alumni Portal!
*Each year in an university, hundreds of students pass out with good jobs/placements. And the ***Alumni Portal*** helps in maintaining
communication between the faculty and the graduates.*
*Alumni portal also presents a great a mean of communication between alumni and current students in the university to interact with each other.*

*In terms of, wastage of resources, the university is losing a lot both financially and opportunity wise, since some of well placed alumni cannot be tracked or contacted to help in donation or support in improvement of infrastructure within the university.*

*This project is focused on web-based application/ web-page, which as a new forms of interactive media between the ANU alumni members and non-alumni members (ANU community).*
